Stability & Variable Flow Rate,BFE,Basic Flowability Energy,"The Basic Flowability Energy is the energy required for a helical blade to traverse down a fixed path through a conditioned powder sample, measured in mJ. This parameter provides an indication of the resistance to movement exhibited by the powder."
,SI,Stability Index,"The Stability Index provides a measure of how physically stable a powder is by comparing the change in flow energy during a series of repeat Test cycles. Stable materials will generate a value close to unity, (0.9<SI<1.1) A Stability Index significantly greater than unity may be indicative of de-aeration, segregation, agglomeration, moisture uptake while a value significantly less than unity suggests attrition, de-agglomeration or presence of a flow additive."
,FRI,Flow Rate Index,"By varying the Blade Tip Speed, the Flow Rate Index indicates how a powder responds to being made to flow at different rates. Typically, a more cohesive powder will generate higher FRI values, while free-flowing materials will exhibit a value close to unity. The presence of flow additives may generate value lower than unity."
,SE,Specific Energy,The Specific Energy is measured as the blade moves upwards through the unconfined sample and provides a measure of the friction and mechanical interlocking between particles. It is recorded during the upward phase of the penultimate and final Conditioning Cycles and is (W7031: Specific Energy) measured in mJ/g. A higher value is associated with greater friction and interlocking which may prevent the powder from flowing under certain conditions.
,CBD,Conditioned Bulk Density,A precise sample volume can be generated using the FT4 Split Vessel. The in-built balance is then used to measure the mass of this sample and automatically calculate the Conditioned Bulk Density in g/ml. Dense powders often have efficiently packed particles with few void spaces. They are therefore less compressible and will typically exhibit less cohesive behavior.
Aeration,AE,Aeration Energy,"The Aerated Energy is the energy required for a helical blade to traverse down a fixed path through a powder sample aerated at a constant velocity of n mm/s. An AE measurement of 10-20 mJ or below indicates that the powder sample has fully fluidised, whereas a high AE measurement suggests that the sample does not effectively aerate at this air velocity. Typically, lower AE is associated with a low degree of interparticular cohesion."
,AR,Aeration Ratio,"The Aeration Ratio is the ratio of the flow energy measured at an air velocity of n mm/s with that at 0 mm/s. A high AR indicates a higher sensitivity to aeration, and is associated with a low degree of interparticular cohesion."
,NAS,Normalised Aerations Sensitivity,NAS represents a powder's sensitivity to a change in air velocity. The change in Flow Energy is normalised against the magnitude of the change in air velocity allowing the aeration behavior of samples requiring different air velocities to effectively aerate to be more easily compared with each other.
Bulk Parameters,CPS,Compressibility Percentage,"Compressibility Index is the measure of the change in density due to an applied Normal Stress, expressed as an index. A high Cl indicates that the material is highly compressible, and can be interpreted as for Compressibility above."
,PD,Pressure Drop across the Powder Bed,"Pressure Drop is the measure of the pressure required to maintain a given flow of air across the powder bed, measured in mbar. A high Pressure Drop across the bed indicates that it is more difficult to transmit air through the sample, and that the powder has low Permeability, whereas a low Pressure Drop indicates that the powder is highly permeable."
Shear Cell,"6COH, 9COH",Cohesion under 6 or 9 kPa,"Cohesion is the theoretical Shear Stress value at zero Normal Stress (i.e. where the Best Fit Line intercepts the y-axis), measured in kPa. A high Cohesion value indicates that the powder would be more difficult to move with purely shearing force."
,"6UYS, 9UYS",Unconfined Yield Strength under 6 or 9 kPa,"The UYS is the greatest value at which the small Mohr circle intercepts the x-axis, (also known as ¥ò), measured in kPa. A high UYS indicates that the powder bulk would be able to maintain its structure more effectively after a consolidating stress was applied and then all stresses removed, whereas a low UYS would indicate that the sample was more likely to fall apart once previously applied stress was removed."
,"6MPS, 9MPS",Major Principle Stress under 6 or 9 kPa,"The MPS is the greatest value at which the large Mohr circle intercepts the x-axis, (also known as 01), measured in kPa. A high MPS indicates that the powder behaves more like a solid than a liquid, whereas a low MPS suggests that the powder behaves more hydrostatically."
,"6FF, 9FF",Flow Function under 6 or 9 kPa,"The ratio of MPS to UYS is referred to as the Flow Function. Typically, a high FF indicates a more free-flowing powder, whereas a low FF suggests that powder is highly resistant to flow under this regime."
,"6AIF, 9AIF",Angle of Internal Friction under 6 or 9 kPa,"The AIF is the angle between the x-axis and the Best Fit Line. A high AIF indicates higher friction between the powder planes, and thus a less free-flowing powder in this mode of flow."
Wall Friction,WFA,Wall Friction Angle,"The WFA is the angle between the x-axis and the linear Best-Fit Line to the five measured data points. A high WFA indicates that the powder would be less free-flowing against the wall surface at high stresses, whereas a low WFA suggests the powder would flow freely against the surface and not be impeded by it."
